# ZimSeudoWizardTemplate

Modified HTML template for exporting content from a Zim (http://zim-wiki.org) Notebook as a "seudowizard" guide.

Instead of Zim standard content Index, guide pages menu shows stacked path nodes from the root to the current page.

Warning: Currently, the template does not support the option "export all pages to a single file".

No warranties or guarantees, please use this at your own risk.
