Zim is a great product editing any type of information, and also has the great advantage that directly uses the Organization in folders and files of the operating system.

But that same feature presents a serious problem for information organized into chapters such as books or manuals: the contents are displayed in lexicographical order and not in the required sequence of chapters. The problem not only affects the application index, but it also affects the contents of the index function when exporting de notebook.

Waiting for the day that the files and folders in the operating system you can sort as a sequence within each parent. By the time, the only possible solution is to prefix each title with the chapters's numbers, letters, etc. But that solution is very straitened: if sections are inserted, removed or compacted,  all sections that appear after the modification must be renamed. 

1. Add a prefix indicating the order of child in parent sequence instead the entire path to the child (ie: just 1 instead 1.2.1).
2. To rename the least possible, do not add order prefixes until the document is very mature.

Anyway, there are some documents organized in the sequence of steps to achieve a goal (for example, a software installation manual). And the case is that, after give many turns to the Zim export process, I have found a trick to show the sequence of steps without prefixing the titles of each step in the sequence.

The Trick uses to assumptions:
