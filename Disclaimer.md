First, I declare that I am used to read english, but rarely I have occasion to express myself in the language. So all contributions to correct texts are welcome... including the text of the previous paragraph, of course :)

Second, I declare that I created the template to edit and generate user manuals with Zim, and I'm satisfied with the result, but I have no idea if the work will be useful for anyone else.

Third, I declare that although I am a programmer, I've never programmed in Python, so any contribution to improve the script code is welcome.

Fourth, I declare that, within the requirements, I have left CSS and HTML code to a level from which any, included myself, can change it according to their needs and taste (in essence I have tried to leave it as similar as posible to Zim default template).
